Who am I?

Born in Helsingborg, Sweden and grow up in the glorious suburbia of Raml√∂sa. 

At the age of 16 I left on a scholarship to finish my high school at Red Cross Nordic United World College in Flekke, Norway. 

After two amazing years I came back to Sweden for a while before the world called and I moved to Bangkok. 

Bangkok was glorious but a university degree seemed like a good idea so packed my bags and moved Edinburgh Scotland.

Fantastic four years in Scotland, with a 4 month detour to Marthas Vineyard, MA, USA, it was time get started with adult life. 

I tried out London, but it didn't work out the way I wanted so had to return to Sweden for a while. A while ended up being two years of teaching before I again packed down everything I owned and moved to Oslo, Norway.

Arrived in Norway in 2009 and my career got going, been here ever since but maybe it is time to get going again?

This does not answer the question of who I am, rather where I have been. But it is a start.
